Results Discussion:

Each directory had a different compression percentage. Out of the three directories,
calgary compressed the most (43.2%), followed by BooksAndHTML (40.5%), followed by waterloo (18.1%).
It's apparent that our program was not able to compress the Waterloo files as effectively as the
other two directories. This could be because Waterloo contains images instead of files based on
text (like ASCII). Images use a wide range of bit values to represent color ranges and pixels, and it
could be that none of these values are repeated too much in an image. One color in a part of an image will
have a different RGB value in another portion due to lighting and camera focus, all contributing to slowing down
the compression process. Text and other file types are more likely to have repeated values, and thus makes compression
more efficient due to not having to create such a large Huffman tree. This is supported by the
fact that the other two folders (calgary and BooksAndHTML) contained mostly text-based files and few images, and
their compression percentages were both very similar and much larger than waterloo's percentage.

As for recompressing an already compressed file, our algorithm and compression results indicate that this process is
slow, inefficient, and accomplishes little. Our total percent compression when recompressing the waterloo directory
is 1.4%, and it took a similar amount of time to compress when compared to the original waterloo directory.
This could be due to the fact that compressing original files operates based on frequency patterns and assigning
coded values to these frequency patterns. Recompressing a compressed file just makes new codes for codes that already
exist, essentially performing the same compression operation on the original file but applying this to the already
compressed file. Thus, little is compressed in the doubly compressed file (because everything was already compressed).

Overall, it seems that the Huffman coding algorithm works best on files that contain a fair amount
of repeated values, such as in text, where many identical characters are either used many, many times, or some
values are not used at all. In files with a wide variety of values (songs, images, movies) compression would take a
longer amount of time due to the fact that a ginormous Huffman Tree would need to be created in order to store all the
different values to code.
